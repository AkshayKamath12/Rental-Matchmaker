# Welcome to RentMatch! 

This is a full-stack platform for connecting aspiring renters. The basis for this idea originated from my own difficulties in college with finding the right people to rent properties with. 

Many people I met were either not great fits or had needs that didnâ€™t align with my own. This tool matches people based on housing needs and streamlines the communication process.

I hope to help other people find ideal housing groups so that individually, each person is able to save on rent and be surrounded by good housemates. 

The application can be boiled down into 4 main parts
1. Create an account and fill in your profile, which includes the location you are looking to rent properties around.
2. Fill out a short form that asks a variety of questions related to housing needs/interests. For each question, you can toggle the weight based on how relevant the question is to you. 
3. Once submitted, access a matches page to see scores that range from 1-100 of other people who have submitted the form. You can adjust the distance slider to adjust the generated matches.
4. From the matches page, you can message any generated match. This will set a chat that you can access through the chat page (from the home page). Due to the incorporation of websockets, 2 users who are chatting with each other can communicate in real time.
